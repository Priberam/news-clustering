Implementation of the paper: Multilingual Clustering of Streaming News, Sebastião Miranda, Artūrs Znotiņš, Shay B. Cohen, Guntis Barzdins, In EMNLP 2018 (http://aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1483)

The original paper, as mentioned above, used proprietary software by Priberam. Unfortunately, we are unable to release this software (because of licensing issues and because it is embedded in a larger C++ system), so we provide a re-implementation in Python that we hope will also be clearer to work with and change.
